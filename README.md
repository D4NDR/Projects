# Projects
Learning projects I complete as I learn to code.


Project 1 - Point of Sale - pointofsale.py
    This project has helped me understand variables. 
    The variables have been changed throughout the program.
    Different data forms have been used, including converting a float to a string.

Project 2 - Magic 8 - magic8.py
    This project has helped understand the flow in programming.
    If/else statements have been used to control the flow.

Project 3 - Shipping Costs - shipping.py
    This project has helped understand the flow in programming.
    This is a more complicated project than project 2.
    Additions made to also print out lowest price option as well as different options. 

Project 4 - Mad Libs Generator - madLibs.py
    This project has developed my learning of how concatenation works in Python. This project will continue to be developed adding in more features as I learn them.
