# Projects
Learning projects I complete as I learn to code.


Project 1 - Point of Sale - pointofsale.py
    This project has helped me understand variables. 
    The variables have been changed throughout the program.
    Different data forms have been used, including converting a float to a string. aa

Project 2 - Magic 8 - magic8.py
    This project has helped understand the flow in programming.
    If/else statements have been used to control the flow.
